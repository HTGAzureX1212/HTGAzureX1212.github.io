It has been a long time since my last post, hasn't it?

## Background Information

It is proverbial that the [IntelliJ Platform](https://www.jetbrains.com/opensource/idea/) has
provided a solid foundation for building and developing powerful development tools for developers.
Indeed, it is no less apparent just by looking at the IDEs JetBrains themselves built on top of
the platform - IntelliJ IDEA, CLion, RustRover, etc., leveraging the immense potential of developing
on the IntelliJ Platform.

Obviously, a plethora of plugins for JetBrains IDEs have been built using the APIs provided by the
IntelliJ Platform, but very few have taken on the task of attempting to build a complete IDE with it.
Thanks to the fact that [the entirety of the IntelliJ Platform is open source](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community) (
including the IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition and PyCharm Community Edition IDEs), developers can read
its code to understand how developing an IDE using the IntelliJ Platform is done and try at it themselves.

[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) is in fact built on top of the IntelliJ Platform,
one of the most prominent IDEs for Android development. This also shows the great potential the IntelliJ
Platform possesses to build paramount development tools for various workflows.

Anyway, this is the commencement of an *n*-part blog series covering the development of an IDE built on
top of the IntelliJ Platform from scratch (where *n* is a positive integer of course), both as a fun "hobby"
project and may also serve as reference text for future developers who also happen to embark on this very same
*I-don't-know-what-colour* brick road of writing an IDE using the IntelliJ Platform.

## Forking and Cloning the IntelliJ Platform

The very first step of developing an IDE on the IntelliJ Platform is *obviously* forking and cloning the
IntelliJ Platform GitHub repository. Unsurprisingly, the IntelliJ Platform repository is *tremendously huge*,
with more than 433K commits on its `master` branch at the time of writing. Appending also the fact that it is a
monorepo, (your fork of the) IntelliJ Platform GitHub repository takes ages to clone if you were to clone
the entire commit history.

Assuming that you have already forked the repository, run the `git clone` command with the `--depth 1` option
to only fetch the most recent commit information and avoid cloning the entire history of the repository (the
following is an example, replace the repository URL with the one of your fork):

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ZigIDE/ZigZen.git --depth 1
```

It is highly recommended that you create a separate branch as your development branch, as the `master` branch
iterates blazingly fast and it can be hard to keep up with latest changes and fixing merge conflicts when they
arise. For my case, I created a separate `nightly` branch from `master` and made that the default branch; and 
merging the changes from `master` to `nightly` regularly and/or when necessary:

Remember to `git checkout` the `master` branch locally, so you can pull and merge changes incoming from `master`
as well.

After that, open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.

## Setting Up Modules and Run Configuration

As I have already written quite some code at the time of writing this, I will show you the module structure of
in this part:

![img.png](assets/2024-02-16-zig_ide_structure.png)

The `com.github.zigzen.main` module is created by first creating it as the directory `zig`, and then deleting its
`src` directory, essentially rendering a module that has no source code at all. Please do note that you create the
modules in the IntelliJ (`.iml`) format!

The rest of the modules are pretty straightforward to create, so I skip it in this blog.

Before we continue, we have to add some dependencies to the `com.github.zigzen.main` module and add a run
configuration for the IDE.

### Module 1: Runtime Dependency `intellij.platform.bootstrap`

To add this *runtime* dependency, add the following line to your `com.github.zigzen.main.iml` file, within the
`component` XML tag:

```xml
<orderEntry type="module" module-name="intellij.platform.bootstrap" scope="RUNTIME" />
```

This module contains the essential `com.intellij.idea.Main` class for starting the bootstrapping process of the
IDE. Without this, the IDE cannot be started.

### Module 2: Dependency `intellij.platform.main`

To add this dependency, add the following line to your `com.github.zigzen.main.iml` file, and similarly, within
the `component` XML tag:

```xml
<orderEntry type="module" module-name="intellij.platform.main" />
```

Why is this dependency necessary?

If you dig through the source code of the `Main.kt` entrypoint, you will find the following line:
```kt
val aClass = AppMode::class.java.classLoader.loadClass("com.intellij.idea.MainImpl")
```

This explicitly looks for and loads the `com.intellij.idea.MainImpl` class by reflection. This class resides in -
surprise surprise - the `intellij.platform.main` module. Note that the module is not a runtime dependency.

### Creating the Run Configuration

To create a run configuration, open the Run Configuration tool window as follows:

![img.png](assets/2024-02-16-runconf_open.png)

After that, you should see a similar window like this:

![img.png](assets/2024-02-16-runconf_window.png)

Create a new configuration using the `+` button in the upper-left corner and name the configuration. For my case, I
named it `ZigZen`.

Select the Java Runtime to use for this run configuration. I downloaded the latest version of the JetBrains Runtime
from [the releases page of the JetBrains Runtime repository](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime/releases/tag/jbr-release-17.0.10b1000.48).
For the `-cp` field, select the module for which its classpath should be used to run the application. This should
be the "empty" module you created, containing the `intellij.platform.bootstrap` and `intellij.platform.main`
dependencies.

You also need to check the `Add VM options` in the `Modify options` drop down:

![img.png](assets/2024-02-16-runconf_dropdown.png)

For the VM options, copy the following and paste it in:

```shell
-Xmx2g

-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=50
-XX:MaxJavaStackTraceDepth=10000

-Didea.platform.prefix=Zig
-Djava.system.class.loader=com.intellij.util.lang.PathClassLoader
```

For the `-Didea.platform.prefix` Java property, replace it with something else of your choice. It is only, in my
case, set to `Zig`.

Finally, set the class `com.intellij.idea.Main` as the main class. You should then have something similar to the
configuration you first saw when opening the Run Configurations tool window.

## Writing the Application Information Manifest

To be fair, I don't know what is the proper name for this, but based on the file I have to create, I will denote
this as the "Application Information Manifest".

Before doing so, add your "resources" module as a runtime dependency to the "empty" main module. For my case, I
added the following to my `com.github.zigzen.main.iml`:

```xml
<orderEntry type="module" module-name="com.github.zigzen.resources" scope="RUNTIME" />
```

After that, head to your "resources" module and create a `resources` directory, marking it as "Resources Root".
Create an `idea` directory and create an XML file named `<Your idea.platform.prefix Property Value>ApplicationInfo.xml`.

For my case, I created a file named `ZigApplicationInfo.xml` as my platform prefix as specified in the
`idea.platform.prefix` property is `Zig`, as aforementioned.

![img.png](assets/2024-02-16-app_info_manifest.png)

I added the following XML to the above created file:

```xml
<component xmlns="http://jetbrains.org/intellij/schema/application-info">
  <version major="2024" minor="1" eap="true"/>
  <company name="ZigIDE" url="https://github.com/ZigIDE"/>
  <build number="ZZ-__BUILD__" date="__BUILD_DATE__"/>
  <logo url="/zigzen_logo.png"/>
  <icon svg="/zigzen.svg" svg-small="/zigzen_16.svg"/>
  <names product="ZigZen" fullname="ZigZen" script="zigzen" motto="Powerful IDE for Zig"/>
</component>
```

Woah, that's quite some stuff to digest. Let's break this down into parts...

### The `version` Tag

This specifies the major and minor versions of the application. The `eap` field specifies whether this version is
an "Early Access Preview" build.

### The `company` Tag

This specifies the vendor of the application. As I didn't really know what to put here... I just put `ZigIDE` and
its repository there lol

### The `build` Tag

This specifies the build number string and build date. The `ZZ` prefix is a unique product code, as you may have
known `IU` corresponds to IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition and `RR` corresponds to RustRover.

The placeholders `__BUILD__` and `__BUILD_DATE__` will be replaced by actual values by the build scripts in the
building process.

### The `logo` Tag

This specifies the image to display for the splash screen on startup.

### The `icon` Tag

This specifies the icons of the application. These are displays on taskbars, and whatnot.

### The `names` Tag

This specifies various names of the application. `product` and `fullname` fields are the names of the application,
and the `script` field is for the name of the script to launch the IDE in an actual binary distribution.

The `motto` field specifies the motto string.

## GitHub Repository

Contributions are very welcome!

## Thoughts

Well, I guess this is it. I'll be preparing for the next edition which should come sometime next month. Leave your
comments down below if you have any questions or pretty much anything, and I'll *attempt* to answer!
